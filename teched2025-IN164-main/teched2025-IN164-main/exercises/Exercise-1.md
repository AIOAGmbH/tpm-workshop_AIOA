The Agreement created from the template with the "by-reference mode" shows a Two-way business transaction, guided by the UN/CEFACT Modelling Methodology. This B2B scenario involves a structured sequence of business transactions between a company and its trading partner to fulfill contractual obligations. This framework is used for ensuring efficient and compliant business collaborations by clearly defining transaction patterns and activities.
